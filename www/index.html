<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>
This project contains scripts to package ArgoUML.
The result of the packaging are "installers"
i.e. something that can be used to install ArgoUML on a host.
"Installers" can be for different platforms and different purposes.
</p>

<p>
There is one directory for each installer.
Each directory contains the configuration files, and tools, 
needed to build a package using that installer.
</p>

<p>
The directory contains a script
doit.bat if that installer is available on a windows platform, and
doit.sh if that installer is available on a unix platform.

For convenience the script
doall.bat runs all the installers that works on a windows platform, and
doall.sh runs all the installers that works on a unix platform.
All scripts assume that argouml has been built or downloaded and
available in
../argouml/build.
</p>

<p>
The documentation of the specifics for each installer is in 
a directory in the web site part of this directory.
Each such set contains:
<ul>
  <li>names and references of the tools needed
  <li>information on the platform needed to run that installer
  <li>the list of tools to install and links to installation instructions.
</ul>

<p>
The result of running the installers is either 
published somewhere on the web
(the <a href="http://argouml-downloads.tigris.org">argouml-downloads project</a>
is one possibility) or
available only for the runner (for burning on cd:s).
(This project was previously used for the purpose of publishing releases.
This is not a good idea and will be discontinued.)
