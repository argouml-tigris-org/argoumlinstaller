<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>
This project contains scripts to package ArgoUML.
The result of the packaging are "installers"
i.e. something that can be used to install ArgoUML on a host.
An "installer" can be
for a specific platform or
for a specific purpose (with a customized set of modules).
</p>
</div>

<div class="h2">
<h2>Organization of the scripts</h2>
<p>
A script is centered around a specific tool.
There is one directory for each script to be run.
The directory contains all the configuration files, and tools,
needed to build a package using that script.
Running the script can result in several installers.
</p>

<p>
Each directory contains the script
doit.sh if the script is runnable on a unix platform, and
doit.bat if the script is runnable on a windows platform.
All scripts assume that argouml has been built or downloaded and
available in
../argouml/build.
This is achieved by running a special script
build-release.sh.
</p>

<p>
The documentation of the specifics for each installer is in 
a directory in the web site part of this directory.
Each such set contains:
<ul>
  <li>information on the platform needed to run that installer
  <li>the list of tools to install and links to installation instructions.
</ul>

<p>
The result of running the installers is either 
published somewhere on the web
(the <a href="http://argouml-downloads.tigris.org">argouml-downloads project</a>
is one possibility) or
available only for the runner (for burning on cd:s).
(This project was previously used for the purpose of publishing releases.
This is not a good idea and will be discontinued.)

<h2>What is done at every official release</h2>
<p>
The offical release consists of the result of some of the scripts.
These scripts are special in that they move the result into a
special directory for the argouml-downloads project.
There is also a "How to do it"-instruction in
<a
    href="http://argouml-stats.tigris.org/documentation/defaulthtml/cookbook/ch02s11.html">Cookbook section on building</a>.
</p>

<p>
These are the scripts used in the official release:
<ul>
  <li><a href="tarzip/">tarzip</a></li>
  <li><a href="appbund/">appbund</a></li>
  <li><a href="javawebstart/">javawebstart</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

Linus Tolke is responsible for issueing official releases of ArgoUML.
