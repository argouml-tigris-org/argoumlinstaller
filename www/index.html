<h3>Mission</h3>
This project contains installers for ArgoUML.<p>

There is one directory for each installer.
Each directory contains the configuration files, and tools, 
needed to build a package using that installer.<p>

The documentation of the specifics for each installer is in 
a directory in the web site part of this directory.
Each such set contains:
<ul>
  <li>names and references of the tools needed
  <li>information on the platform needed to run that installer
  <li>the list of tools to install and links to installation instructions.
</ul>
<p>

The result of running the installers is either 
published somewhere on the web
(the <a href="http://argouml-download.tigris.org">argouml-download project</a>
is one possibility) or
available only for the runner (for burning on cd:s).
(This project was previously used for the purpose of publishing releases.
This is not a good idea and will be discontinued.)
<p>
