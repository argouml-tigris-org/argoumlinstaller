<h3>Mission</h3>
This project contains installers for ArgoUML.<p>

There is one directory for each installer.
Each directory contains the configuration files, and tools, 
needed to build a package using that installer.<p>

The directory contains a script
doit.bat if that installer is available on a windows platform, and
doit.sh if that installer is available on a unix platform.

For convenience the script
doall.bat runs all the installers that works on a windows platform, and
doall.sh runs all the installers that works on a unix platform.
All scripts assume that argouml has been built or downloaded and
available in
../argouml/build.
<p>

The documentation of the specifics for each installer is in 
a directory in the web site part of this directory.
Each such set contains:
<ul>
  <li>names and references of the tools needed
  <li>information on the platform needed to run that installer
  <li>the list of tools to install and links to installation instructions.
</ul>
<p>

The result of running the installers is either 
published somewhere on the web
(the <a href="http://argouml-downloads.tigris.org">argouml-downloads project</a>
is one possibility) or
available only for the runner (for burning on cd:s).
(This project was previously used for the purpose of publishing releases.
This is not a good idea and will be discontinued.)
<p>

<h3>Documentation for each of the different installers</h3>
The following installers are candidates to investigate:
<ul>
  <li>zerog: Installer tool from <a href="http://www.zerog.com">ZeroG</a>.
- not implemented
  <li>nsis: <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net">Nullsoft</a>
- not implemented
(suggested by Graham Compton
<a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3705">issue 3705</a>)
</ul>
