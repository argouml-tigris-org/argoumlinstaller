<h2>tarzip</h2>

<p>
The tarzip script creates three pairs of files called
Xxx.suffix,
Xxx-libs.suffix, and
Xxx-src.suffix
where suffix is both zip for a zipped file and
tar.gz for a gzipped tar archive.
Xxx is the name of the release.
</p>

<p>
It also
creates the directory in the argouml-downloads project,
copies the documentation (pdf files) and
create an index.html file.
</p>

<div class="h3">
<h3>Tools used</h3>
<p>
It must be run on a Cygwin system (probably a Unix system will do).
</p>

<p>
On top of the really basic unix commands (sh, mkdir, ls, cp, cat, rm, test, echo)
the following are needed:
jar (from $JAVA_HOME/bin/jar)
sed,
awk,
tar, and
gzip.
