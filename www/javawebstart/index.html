<div class="h2">
<h2>javawebstart</h2>

<p>
The script is called createJWS.sh.
</p>

<p>
The javawebstart script copies the files to the maven2-like structure
in the argouml-downloads project
used for storing the javawebstart jars and
creates the jnlp file.
</p>

<p>
The version of each jar file is controlled by the LAYOUT file.
A file in the LAYOUT file is either "argouml-provided" i.e. it will be
created with the same version as the argouml release or
not "argouml-provided" i.e. it will be created with the version number
in the LAYOUT file that is the same version number as that jar file is
known with.

<div class="h3">
<h3>Tools used</h3>
<p>
It must be run on a Cygwin system (probably a Unix system will do).
</p>

<p>
On top of the really basic unix commands (sh, mkdir, ls, cp, cat, rm, test, echo, basename, tr, chmod)
the following are needed:
grep,
sed,
awk,
cmp,
unzip,
diff
